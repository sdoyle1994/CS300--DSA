# CS300-DSA
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?<br /> 
The problem that needed to be solved in the projects for this course was determining which data structure would be the most efficient based on run time analysis and memory, and write the code using that data structure. Based on my analysis, I chose the vector due to the small amount of courses and the courses needing to be sorted in alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.<br /> 
To solve the problem, I determined the Big-O value of each data structure reading from the file and creating course objects. To help determine the Big-O value of each data structure, I used an analysis chart to find the total cost of the algorithm step by step.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?<br /> 
To overcome the roadblocks during the projects, I used zybooks and youtube to help me better understand Big-O notation.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?<br /> 
After completing this project, I became more aware of how important it is to use the appropriate data structure for particular projects based on run time and memory. Choosing the right data structure will allow algorithms to be more efficient and save space.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?<br /> 
After completing this project, I feel that I became better with writing organized code that is easy to read and well documented. Also, I designed my project to be able to tolerate change and still be able to run smoothly. For example, if the amount of classes increases or decreases, my program won't be affected and will still work.
